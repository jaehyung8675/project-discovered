Discoverd

Demo - https://project-discovered.netlify.app

I built a Full-Stack web application using React with an online database to give users more ways to discover, share, and interact information in real-time.

- Designed user interface and components to provide a simple user experience.
- Created an online database called Supabase and integrated with the front-end part by using APIs.
- Implemented rendering real-time data into the user interface for interaction with clients.
- Implemented filtering and voting system using React useState Hook and Props.
- Tested the exchange of data between servers and users using Node.js.
